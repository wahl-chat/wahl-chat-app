# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Compliance with the German Constitution (Grundgesetz)

This project is committed to upholding the basic principles of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz), particularly:

- **Article 1 (Human Dignity)**: Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority. We are committed to respecting the inherent dignity and worth of every individual in our community.

- **Article 3 (Equality)**: All persons shall be equal before the law. No person shall be favored or disfavored because of sex, parentage, race, language, homeland and origin, faith, or religious or political opinions. No person shall be disfavored because of disability. We ensure equal treatment and opportunities for all community members.

- **Article 5 (Freedom of Expression)**: Every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate their opinions in speech, writing, and pictures. We support constructive discourse while maintaining a respectful environment.

These principles guide our community interactions and inform our standards of behavior.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient and understanding with people of varying technical skill levels
* Respecting the time and effort of community members
* Providing and receiving feedback in a constructive manner

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Violent threats or language directed against another person
* Discriminatory jokes and language
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include:

* Using an official project e-mail address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Contributing to project repositories
* Participating in project discussions, issues, and pull requests
* Attending project-related events or meetings
* Any other interaction in project-related forums or platforms

This Code of Conduct also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email**: info@wahl.chat

For questions or concerns specifically related to contributions, you may also contact:

**Email**: robin@wahl.chat

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident. Reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.
